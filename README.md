Hexapod-Robot
=============

This repository basically will explain the working of hexapod robot along with arduino code responsible for its movement in coordination &amp; acting as a surveillance over a specified area.<br />
Features of our Hexapod robot are as follows:- <br />
1.Hexapod Robot was developed using Arduino micro-controller that can secure the perimeter of a given area.
2.It will trigger a remotely connected alarm system in case of any intrusion over the specified perimeter.

<br />
The first file contains the code of just movement of hexapod robot using three servo instead of six servo to make it economical.
<br />
The second file also includes surveillance part alongwith the movement of hexapod robot.
<br/>
The logic behind the working of hexapod robot is also explained properly in two pdf presentation alongwith dimension  of legs & body that we have to take to prepare well functional hexapod robot.
