Hexapod-Robot
=============

This repository basically will explain the working of hexapod robot along with arduino code responsible for its movement in coordination &amp; acting as a surveillance over a specified area.<br />
Features of our Hexapod robot are as follows:- <br />
1.Hexapod Robot was developed using Arduino micro-controller that can secure the perimeter of a given area.<br />
2.It will trigger a remotely connected alarm system in case of any intrusion over the specified perimeter.
<br />

The youtube link of the video of hexaod robot is given below:- <br />

<br />
The first file contains the code of just movement of hexapod robot using three servo instead of six servo to make it economical.
<br />
The second file also includes surveillance part alongwith the movement of hexapod robot.
<br/>
The logic behind the working of hexapod robot is also explained properly in two pdf presentation alongwith dimension  of legs and body that we have to take to prepare well functional hexapod robot.
